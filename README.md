# DSA

Contains special algorithms and data structres for DSA.

## Data structures
1. Disjoint set template (with rank heuristic and path compression)

## Algorithms
1. Median of two sorted arrays (logarithmic time complexity)
2. GCD of two numbers (logarithmic time complexity)
3. Find if a string is interleaving of two strings (O(mn) m,n length of string 1 and 2)
